The goal was to build a website capable of presenting the clinic (showcasing a carousel with images of the office at the top) and its professionals, displaying the services offered, showing contact information, and allowing patients to send emails to schedule appointments.\nThe main challenges during the development of this project were learning how to use Next.js and discovering the best way to ensure responsiveness across different screen sizes.

				"title": "SamsAI",

The application is also integrated with RAG to provide legal context to the model, enabling it to answer users' questions.",
				"full-description": "In 2025, during the final year of my Computer Science degree, I developed, together with my colleagues, the capstone project titled “Evaluation of the performance of an LLM application with RAG in solving Environmental Law questions.” Given the slowness and overload of the Brazilian judicial system due to the large number of ongoing cases, the goal of the research was to evaluate whether a chatbot architecture integrated with the Sabiá-3 model, which implements the RAG technique to retrieve relevant excerpts from environmental legislation and provide them as context to the model, could assist the judiciary in this scenario. To evaluate the AI’s performance, we selected questions from the Brazilian Bar Exam (OAB) and ENADE (Law) related to environmental topics.\nThe chatbot front-end, developed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, was inspired by the interfaces of modern large language models. In addition to a chat interface between the user and the AI, it allows PDF files to be attached to messages. The back-end was developed in Django and is responsible for integrating the Sabiá-3 model via API, querying the vector database, storing, deleting, and updating user conversation data in a PostgreSQL database, and returning information to the front-end.\nThe main challenge of this project was learning how to design an LLM architecture integrated with RAG in a way that maximized model performance. Additionally, at the beginning, integrating the front-end and back-end was challenging due to the need to implement multiple routes to handle CRUD operations for conversations, messages, and documents, as well as routes for accessing chat, registration, and login screens.

				"full-description": "In order to develop my skills with the Python Django framework (and a bit of front-end as well), I decided to create a weather website inspired by the Mackenzie weather station website that I developed while working at the Mackleaps junior enterprise. The front-end of the site, built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap, consists of a single page where the user enters the name of a city in Brazil or elsewhere in the world into a search field, and the WeatherAPI returns the local weather information, which is displayed on a dashboard.\nThe back-end is integrated with a PostgreSQL database that stores data for all Brazilian capitals and sends the names of these capitals to the front-end to be displayed below the input field, creating an autocomplete feature that helps users find weather information for the desired city and improves website usability.\nThe main challenges of this project were learning how to use Bootstrap in a web application, manipulating HTML elements using the DOM, and configuring charts in JavaScript using the Chart.js library.

				"full-description": "Like the Weather Station project, this is another project I developed in December 2024 to improve my skills with the Django framework and front-end development. In this application, users can create an account using a valid CPF and access it to make withdrawals, deposits, and even PIX transfers, which can be viewed in the transaction history table.\nThe main challenge in this project was learning how to use Django as a whole, as I was still in the early stages of learning the framework. As a result, building the back-end was difficult, as it handles CRUD operations in a PostgreSQL database and must correctly update information on the front-end. In addition, I faced challenges in building the transaction history table and validating the input fields in the registration forms, but I was able to find a solution by using the Datatables and Parsley.js libraries, respectively.

				"title": "The Concierge",
				"mini-description": "During college, I developed a remote-controlled cart operated by a mobile application using Arduino. Its purpose was to carry objects for the user, reducing physical effort — the Concierge.",
				"full-descrition": "In the second semester of the Computer Science program, at the beginning of 2022, I developed a remote-controlled cart operated by a mobile application using Arduino. Its purpose was to carry objects for the user, reducing physical effort. Since the cart performs a role similar to that of a concierge — a hotel employee responsible for carrying guests’ luggage — we decided to name it the Concierge. The Concierge was built using an Arduino UNO board connected to an H-bridge to control the four motors responsible for wheel movement, as well as an HC-05 Bluetooth module to connect with the mobile application that sent driving commands to the cart.\nAdditionally, to prevent excessive weight on the Concierge, a scale and an I2C LCD display were connected to the Arduino to calculate and display the weight of the carried items. If more than 1.5 kg was placed on the cart, the display would indicate an overload.

				"title": "Automated Parking Lot",
				"mini-description": "In the final year of the electronics course at Liceu, I built a scale model of an automated parking system as my capstone project. The model consisted of a parking lot where light sensors installed in the parking spaces detected the presence of a car through changes in light intensity. Click to learn more!",
				"full-description": "In the final year of the technical electronics program, in 2020, after observing how vehicle control and monitoring are carried out in some shopping malls in the city of São Paulo, the idea arose to develop a capstone project titled “Automated Parking System.” The goal was to automate the control and monitoring of a parking lot, ensure the rights of elderly and disabled individuals to park in reserved spaces, and provide more accurate overall space utilization control. The system includes:<ul><li>LDR light sensors to detect the presence of vehicles;</li><li>Two servo motors acting as entry and exit gates;</li><li>An RGB LED for each parking space, indicating availability through colors (free, occupied, or reserved for disabled users);</li><li>An RC522 RFID reader for one of the reserved spaces to identify whether the vehicle belongs to an elderly or disabled person via a tag;</li><li>An LCD display showing the number of available parking spaces;</li><li>An HC-05 Bluetooth module responsible for sending a message to the parking security staff’s mobile phone if a vehicle parks in a reserved space without the appropriate tag;</li><li>An Arduino Mega board programmed to control LEDs, the display, and other components.</li></ul>Thus, when a car enters the parking lot, the LDR sensor at the entrance detects its presence and opens the gate, unless the parking lot is full — in which case the gate remains closed and the display shows the message “PARKING LOT FULL.” In an available space, the LED turns green; if the space is reserved, it turns blue.\nTherefore, this capstone project provides a solution to optimize the time spent searching for parking spaces, prevent overcrowding, and reduce the need for additional staff to manage the parking lot.
